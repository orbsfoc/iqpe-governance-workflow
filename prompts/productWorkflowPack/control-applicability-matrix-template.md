# Control Applicability Matrix

Use this file as `docs/plans/control-applicability-matrix.md`.

For every resolved planning-behavior control and role intent, record applicability before phase-03 can pass.

| Control/Intent ID | Source Artifact | Applicability (APPLICABLE/NOT-APPLICABLE) | Rationale | Owner | Approval Status (APPROVED/PROPOSED/BLOCKED) | Implementation Evidence Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CTRL-001 | docs/planning-behavior-resolution.md | APPLICABLE | Required for this run scope | architect-owner | APPROVED | docs/... | |

Rules:
- Every row must have owner and approval status.
- `APPLICABLE` rows require implementation evidence before phase-03 PASS.
- `NOT-APPLICABLE` rows require approved rationale.
- Rows with partial/skipped application must be tracked in `docs/plans/intent-control-accountability.md`.
