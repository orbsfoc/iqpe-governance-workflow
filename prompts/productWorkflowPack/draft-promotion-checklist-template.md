# Draft Promotion Checklist Template

Use this checklist when promoting draft outputs from `docs/drafts/**` to canonical `docs/**`.

## Promotion metadata
- Phase:
- Draft source root:
- Canonical target root:
- Owner reviewer:
- Promotion timestamp (UTC):

## Required checks
- [ ] Draft-to-canonical path mapping recorded (`docs/drafts/**` -> `docs/**`)
- [ ] ID integrity validated (`REQ/PLAN/DIAG/TC/TEST/DEF` unchanged or explicitly migrated)
- [ ] Authority fields validated (`Authoritative Source`, `Approval Owner`, `Approval Status`)
- [ ] Citations and provenance links remain valid
- [ ] MCP evidence references still resolve
- [ ] Owner sign-off recorded

## Decision
- Promotion status: APPROVED | REJECTED | NEEDS_REWORK
- Notes:
