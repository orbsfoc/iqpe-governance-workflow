# Intent and Control Accountability Log

Use this file as `docs/plans/intent-control-accountability.md` when approved intent/control is partially applied or skipped.

| Intent/Control ID | Impacted Artifact | Application Status (PARTIAL/SKIPPED) | Rationale | Owner | Approval Status (APPROVED/PROPOSED/BLOCKED) | Remediation Action | Target Closure Phase |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CTRL-001 | docs/plans/control-applicability-matrix.md | PARTIAL | Missing implementation evidence for one workstream | architect-owner | APPROVED | Complete evidence update and re-run gate | 03 |

Rules:
- Every PARTIAL/SKIPPED item must include owner, remediation action, and closure phase.
- Missing accountability entries for partial/skipped items keeps status `BLOCKED`.
