# Known Blockers

Track open blockers that prevent deterministic progression or release readiness.

| Blocker ID | Phase | Description | Owner | ETA (UTC) | Evidence Path | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BLK-001 | 01 | Example blocker | <owner> | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ | docs/tooling/<artifact>.json | OPEN |

Rules:
- Every OPEN blocker must include owner, ETA, and evidence path.
- Blockers with missing ownership/ETA/evidence are governance violations.
- Close blockers only with explicit evidence link and timestamp.
